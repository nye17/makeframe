# makeframe


I made this simple script more than a decade ago to make an explosion of
matplotlib axes for plotting multi-panel figures. This script allows you to
configure all aspects of the figure accurately. I am pretty sure there are
better alternatives on the market but I have been using this script for many
years and I am very happy with it.
